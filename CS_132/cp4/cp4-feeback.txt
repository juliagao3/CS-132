Please fill out the following and submit with your CP 4 submission (added to help us know what to focus on when grading):

1. What have you learned and applied in CP 4 since previous assignments?
From CP3, I learned about fetch and was able apply that into CP4 with writing our own endpoints
and then fetching from them in order to incorporate into my personal webiste. I was also able to
learn to apply and dynamically load items onto the page with generating the tags and appending them.
Futhermore, I also applied information from CP1 with the flex layout and being able to create the layout
that I wanted. 
2. To what extent would you like feedback in CP 4 (e.g. thorough, particular areas of API design/implementation)?
I would like thorough feedback since it is my personal webiste and I want to learn as much as I can
and where to improve.
3. Anything else you would like the grader to know?
My project is on GitHub because I have too many images.
