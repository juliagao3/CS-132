                        </header>
                        <p>
                            I am an only child. I was born in St. Louis, Missouri before moving to 
                            Shanghai, China around a few months old. At 6 years old, I came back 
                            for kindergarten in Rochester, New York. At the end of second grade, 
                            I moved to Greensboro, North Carolina where my dad had a new job as a
                            teaching professor. During the summer of my fourth grade, I went to 
                            live with my mother in Union, Kentucky since she found a job at Toyota.
                            I finished elementary school there. In middle school after seventh 
                            grade, there was a big move by Toyota to Texas. Thus, I moved to 
                            Frisco, Texas. This is where I stayed for high school with my whole 
                            family as my dad came to Texas as well. Finally, I came to California 
                            for college and hope to stay after I graduate!

                A favorites hobby of mine is to travel around to new places and meet new 
                people and cultures.

                         This was in winter of 2023 at one of the best snow resorts. It 
                         was one of my best ski trips yet. I went with my friends and 
                         also met so many new people.

                    <p>
                         This was in fall of 2023 for my term study abroad. I went to
                         Cambridge University. On my free weekends, I would go visit London
                         and the tourist attractions such as London Eye, Tower of London, 
                         and London Bridge. It was really amazing!

                    <p>
                         This was in the summer of 2019 before COVID. I went with my family. 
                         On this trip, we went to both Prague and Salzburg. I really enjoyed
                         visiting the churches as well as the city and taking pictures.
