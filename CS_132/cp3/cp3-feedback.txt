Please fill out the following and submit with your CP 3 submission (added to help us know what 
to focus on when grading):

1. What have you learned and applied in CP 3 since CP 1?
I have learned how to fetch data from open source API's and be able to incorporate them 
into our project. For mine, because I talked about my hobby of traveling, I was able to 
pull actual data for each of these countries in case the user would like to learn more about
the countries that I traveled to.
2. To what extent would you like feedback in CP 3 (e.g. thorough, particular areas of 
HTML/CSS/JS/UI)?
I would like thorough feedback since I would like this to be my personal website when I apply
to future jobs/grad school.
3. Anything else you would like the grader to know?
