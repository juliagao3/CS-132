Please fill out the following and submit with your CP 2 submission (added to help us know what 
to focus on when grading):

1. What have you learned and applied in CP 2 since CP 1?
I have learned about how to not use extra tags that are unnecessary as well as layout and 
formatting. I also think that I have learned how to incorporate javascript into the websites
to allow user interactivity. Furthermore, I have learned more about which tags should be used.
2. To what extent would you like feedback in CP 2 (e.g. thorough, particular areas of 
HTML/CSS/JS/UI)?
I would like thorough feedback since I would like this to be my personal website when I apply
to future jobs/grad school.
3. Anything else you would like the grader to know?
My project is on GitHub since I have too many images.
